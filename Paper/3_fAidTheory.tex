\section*{How Natural Disasters Affect Foreign Aid Allocations}

Only in the twentieth century has expending public resources to relieve the human suffering of foreigners shifted from being a virtually inconceivable act to relatively commonplace. The devastation wrought by the two world wars was particularly instrumental in bringing about this change. However, such aid was strictly intended to serve as temporary transfers that would facilitate a return to the previous status quo, rather than a long-term commitment to ``development'' as such. The turn toward development aid was instead fostered by ongoing Cold War hostilities, which simultaneously promoted the use of aid to further donor's strategic goals while also building a new norm of rich countries aiding poor countries \citep{lancaster:2008}.

The role of mitigating disaster and suffering on the one hand and furthering strategic interest on the other are baked into the modern conception of foreign aid. This history also suggests that initial humanitarian aid, though meant to serve as a temporary expedient, may lead to the establishment of aid with longer-term strategic goals. Whether this pattern exists more generally and if so, whether it is driven primarily by strategic or humanitarian concerns is unclear however. The role of the Cold War in foreign aid's origin story  dictated that recipients of humanitarian aid were generally within a particular strategic bloc, making it difficult to untangle strategic from humanitarian drivers. The vignette of US-Iran aid relations following the 2003 Bam earthquake provides some anecdotal evidence, however, that contrasting examples exist.

As such, looking at how natural disasters affect foreign aid allocation is not only interesting in its own right but also provides an exogenous instrument with which to identify the role of donor interest and recipient need in explaining patterns of aid commitments. To that end, we derive and test four hypotheses as to how natural disasters affect foreign aid allocations. Further to better entangle the varying strategic motivations, we disaggregate foreign aid into three types: humanitarian, civil society, and development aid. In doing so, we seek to offer a more nuanced understanding of the principle drivers of foreign aid allocations. 

\subsection*{Short-term Humanitarian Response to Natural Disasters}

Responding to natural disasters quickly and efficiently is often crucial to saving lives and alleviating human suffering. The first 72 hours after a natural disaster are often critical as services like electricity, gas, water, and telecommunications may all be disrupted. The timely deployment of humanitarian aid is the first response that donors can extend to countries struck by natural disaster. In what follows, we develop two hypotheses as to how the interaction between strategic interests and natural disaster severity can affect humanitarian aid allocation. 

\subsubsection*{Realist Imperviousness to Natural Disasters}

The logic of realism dictates that countries are driven by self-interest to amass power in a zero-sum game. Thus, realist scholars expound the view that ``foreign aid is today and will remain for some time an instrument of political power'' \citep{liska:1960}. Under this logic, donors commit aid to recipient countries primarily to further their own strategic interests. Extant literature on the drivers of foreign aid have put forward strong substantive evidence to support this viewpoint.

With regards to the interaction between natural disasters and strategic interests, the realist perspective suggests that donors do not send more humanitarian aid to their strategic opponents in the event of a natural disaster as it is against their self-interest to do so. Rather, it would be in donor self-interest to send humanitarian aid to their strategic allies in the event of a natural disaster. This does not imply that donors never send humanitarian aid to their strategic opponents, only that they are more likely to send aid to their strategic allies. 

Indeed, disaster-afflicted countries appear to be sensitive to the possibility that accepting humanitarian aid from strategic opponents may come with strings attached. In 1999 for example, Venezuela experienced catastrophic flash floods and debris flows in Vargas State, which left as much as 10\% of the Vargas population dead \citep{wieczorek:2001}. US troops helped in the relief efforts by running helicopter rescue missions and working to provide clean water. However, consistent with his antagonism toward US hegemony in the region, President Hugo Chavez declined US assistance in rebuilding a critical highway, saying that while, ``he would accept American equipment if Venezuelan soldiers operated it...he did not want US troops in his country.''\footnote{Brand, Richard. `Chavez assailed on handling of Venezuelan flood disaster.' \textit{The Miami Herald}. 5 August 2001. Accessed September 2017: \url{http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/venezuela/venezuela-disaster.htm}.} Meanwhile, Iran categorically refused any aid from Israel following the 2003 Bam earthquake, though the Israeli government still encouraged its citizens to donate privately.\footnote{Popper, Nathaniel. ``Israelis Help Iran Victims Despite Rebuff.'' \textit{The Forward}. 2 January 2004. Accessed September 2017: \url{http://forward.com/news/6059/israelis-help-iran-victims-despite-rebuff/}} %Indeed, even the US first turned down Russian aid for Hurricane Katrina before ultimately accepting it.\footnote{`U.S. accepts Russian Katrina aid.' \textit{UPI}. 2 September 2005. Accessed September 2017. \url{https://www.upi.com/US-accepts-Russian-Katrina-aid/39221125680989/}.}

The logic of hard-nosed realism leads us to the following hypothesis as to how the interaction between natural disasters and strategic aid affects humanitarian aid allocations: 

\textit{H1A: Donors are driven by self-interest and in the event of a natural disaster, donors are more likely to send \textbf{humanitarian aid} to their strategic allies than their strategic opponents.}

\subsubsection*{Natural Disasters as (Temporary) Humanizers of Strategic Opponents}

Conversely, social context, rather than material interest, may be decisive in foreign aid allocation decisions. Recent research in behavioral economics also underscores the idea that different social contexts lead to varying behavior in identical situations \citep{kahneman:2003,do:2011}. While there is evidence that non-governmental organizations are driven by the norms of humanitarian discourse when allocating aid \citep{buthe:2012}, evidence for similar behavior in governments has been mixed at best. Natural disasters may reorient the social context of a dyadic relationship to encourage donors to increase aid to their strategic opponents. That is, the loss of human life and destruction of infrastructure, which natural disasters provoke, can temporarily serve to emphasize the human aspect of the bilateral relationship as opposed to the  political, economic, and military aspects that generally define foreign relations between two countries.

Moreover, if natural disasters do have a humanizing effect, than we might expect strategic opponents to be particularly sensitive to it. This is, given that strategic opponents are more likely to ``otherize'' each other, then dyadic opponents must traverse a greater gap to humanize each another compared to dyadic allies  \citep{de:2012}. For example, seeing disaster befall Cubans may humanize them more for Americans compared to Russians. More explicitly, historically hostile relations between the US and Cuba may mean that the baseline extent to which they ``otherize'' each other is much greater than in the Russian-Cuban relationship, increasing the potential for Cubans to be humanized in American eyes compared to Russian ones. \footnote{Note, regardless of the actual motivation of donors when they give aid to their strategic opponents, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that aid given under such circumstances can also serve to humanize the donors as well. For example, in the wake of US and South Korean aid for the North Korean famine, one refugee summarized his reaction to the US Institute for Peace this way: ``We were taught all these years that the South Koreans and Americans were our enemies. Now we see they are trying to feed us. We are wondering who our real enemies are'' \citet{natsios:1999}. This suggests that to some extent, social context can matter.}

That is not to say that natural disasters can always bridge this divide among strategic opponents. For example, India and Pakistan have had an uneasy history in accepting aid from each other following natural disasters.\footnote{Ravishankar, Siddharth. `Cooperation between India and Pakistan after Natural Disasters.' \textit{Stimson Center}. 9 January 2015. Accessed September 2017: \url{https://www.stimson.org/content/cooperation-between-india-and-pakistan-after-natural-disasters}} In general, we contend only that natural disasters may make it more \textit{likely} that a strategic adversary will contribute aid because the humanitarian disaster temporarily reframes the context of bilateral relations. An understanding of the interaction between natural disasters and strategic interests affects humanitarian aid allocations based on social context thus leads us to the following hypothesis:

\textit{H1B:  Donors who are strategic opponents of the recipient are more likely than strategic allies to be sensitive to the humanizing effect of natural disasters, and, consequently, are likely to send more \textbf{humanitarian aid}.} 

\subsection*{Long-term Responses to Natural Disasters}

Donor countries may dispense aid that not only serves to immediately address the natural disaster at hand, but also through other channels that have longer-term objectives. Here, we make a distinction between civil society aid and development aid. Civil society aid is aimed at supporting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and their programs. Often, the goal of such aid is to empower grass-roots advocacy and improve governance and government accountability. Meanwhile, development aid is targeted toward promoting long-term economic development in a recipient country often through the building of infrastructure like roads and hospitals as well as the building of human resources via technical training and education. In what follows, we develop hypotheses as to how the interaction between strategic interest and natural disasters can affect the allocation of these two different types of aid.

\subsubsection*{Natural Disasters as Strategic Opportunities}

If, as following the realist logic, foreign aid is used to promote donor interests, then donor governments should be especially inclined to increase the allocation of civil society aid. This is because aiding the development of civil society is an inherently political act.\footnote{\url{http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/21/the-prickly-politics-of-aid/}} From supporting the growth of government watch dogs to increasing the domestic capacity for grass roots advocacy, whether it is their intention or not, donors are able to exert influence over a recipients domestic politics by directing funds to civil society.


With respect to natural disasters, countries may be motivated to give more civil society aid to their strategic opponents because the temporary suspension in the normal dynamics of the relationship represents a unique opportunity to increase civil society aid and initiate a shift in the nature of the bilateral relationship. That is, donor countries may either already recognize all to well or come to recognize that the natural disasters offers an opportunity to improve the terms of their relationship with the affected country. Either way, donors can seize on a country's inherent vulnerability following a natural disaster to  decide to \textit{strategically} increase their civil aid so as to increase their chances of exerting domestic influence over the recipient countries. As such, we derive the following hypothesis:

\textit{H2: Natural disasters present an opportune window for donors to exert influence over recipients who are their strategic opponents and as such, donors are more likely to send additional \textbf{civil society aid} to their strategic opponents.}  

\subsubsection*{Natural Disasters as (Permanent) Humanizers of Strategic Opponents}

Whereas humanitarian aid provides stop-gap measures to address the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, the focus of development aid is to build the conditions for long-term, sustainable economic growth. As such, if social context matters, natural disasters can have a humanizing effect on strategic opponents that is not only short-term, but long-term, then this should be manifested in an increase in development aid. That is, the initial devastation wrought by a natural disaster may not only encourage greater humanitarian aid, but may also encourage greater contact and mutual understanding between donors and recipients and a greater donor commitment to recipient development. As in H1B, strategic opponents may be particularly sensitive to this humanizing effect because relative to strategic allies, they are more likely to have had a dehumanizing view of the recipient country. This results in the final hypothesis:

\textit{H3: Natural disasters have a long-term humanizing effect on their strategic opponents and as such, donors are more likely to send greater \textbf{development aid} to their strategic opponents.}  

\section*{Measuring Strategic Relationships}

One reason for evaluating the \textit{motivations} for aid and not aid \textit{outcomes} is that aid given for strategic reasons may still further development objectives, albeit incidentally, while aid given for humanitarian reasons may also bring unexpected strategic benefits \citep{maizels:1984}. However, evaluating the motivations for aid is not a straightforward process -- any given aid project may work toward providing assistance to a recipient country as well as strategic benefits to a donor country. 

Of critical importance to investigating whether strategic considerations (and by extension, the interaction between strategic considerations and humanitarian need) affects foreign aid considerations then is constructing a reliable measure of strategic interest. Unfortunately, we find that \citet{alesina:2000}'s remark that  ``the measurement of what a `strategic interest' is varies from study to study and is occasionally tautological,'' still holds true.  Indeed, strategic interest has alternately been operationalized as: trade intensity \citep{berthelemy:2004,bermeo:2008,hoeffler:2011}, UN voting scores \citep{alesina:2000, alesina:2002,hoeffler:2011,dreher:2012}, arms transfers \citep{maizels:1984}, colonial legacy \citep{alesina:2000, bermeo:2008, berthelemy:2004,berthelemy:2006}, alliances \citep{bermeo:2008,schraeder.etal:1998}, regional dummies \citep{bermeo:2008,berthelemy:2006, maizels:1984}, bilateral dummies \citep{alesina:2000, berthelemy:2004, berthelemy:2006}\footnote{A US-Egypt or US-Israel dummy seems to be the most common instance of a bilateral dummy} or some combination of the above.\footnote{Meanwhile other papers take a negative approach and argue that any shortfall between what would theoretically be expected from poverty-efficient aid allocation and actual aid allocation \citep{collier:2002,nunnenkamp:2006,thiele:2007}, or similarly between a theoretical allocation based on good governance and actual aid allocation \citep{dollar:2006,neumayer:2005}, is evidence of strategic interest at play.} 

Such inconsistency in the operationalization of strategic interest is not simply a matter of using different variables to measure the same concept but a matter of using different variables to measure different \textit{aspects} of the underlying concept. However, while a dyad's strategic bilateral relationship is quite multifaceted, to date, there has not been a readily available measure of strategic relationships which captures its various aspects the same way that scholars have done for other complex concepts.\footnote{For example, Polity and Freedom House have provided measures or political institutions while the World Bank's World Governance Indicators (WGI) project provides measures for six dimensions of governance} To address this problem, we create a new measure of strategic interest that is able to account for varying aspects of strategic interest. 

\subsection*{A new measure of strategic relationships}

To generate a measure of strategic relationships we adopt a latent variable approach that enables us to estimate a relational measure of interest between countries by taking into account the direct and indirect ways in which states are connected across a variety of dimensions. Specifically, we utilize three dimensions of state relations to construct our strategic interest measure: dyadic alliances, UN voting, and joint membership in intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). We focus on these dimensions because each provides a representation of the political and military relations between countries in the international system. Additionally, these measures are commonly employed in the foreign aid literature to measure strategic interest. Dyadic alliances largely capture the strategic and military aspect of country relationships. Meanwhile, joint membership in IGOs reflects the dyadic relationship across many political issue areas, and UN voting is better able to capture this relationship in a centralized forum. 

To estimate a measure of strategic interest across these dimensions, we take a network based approach that allows us to leverage both the direct and indirect ways in which states are connected to one another. To do this we employ a latent factor model as described in \citet{hoff:2005}. The model is structured as follows:

\begin{align}
\begin{aligned}
	Y = \textbf{u}_{i}^{T} & \textbf{u}_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \text{, where} \\
	&\textbf{u}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{R=2}, \; i \in \{1, \ldots, n \} \\
	% &\Lambda \text{ a } K \times K \text{ diagonal matrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align}

$Y$ here is a $n \times n$ undirected sociomatrix in which $y_{ij}$ designates whether there exists a link (e.g., an alliance) between $i$ and $j$. The goal of the model is to provide a projection of the systematic variation in $Y$ into a low-dimensional social space.\footnote{The latent factor model we utilize here is based on an eigvenvalue decomposition that seeks to represent relations between countries as the weighted inner-product of country-specific vectors of latent characteristics. In this application, we project our $n \times n$ sociomatrix into a $n \times 2$ matrix of country positions in a latent social space.} More precisely, the types of systematic variation that we are interested in include the concepts of (a) transitivity, (b) balance and (c) clusterability. Formally, a set of three countries $ijk$ is said to be transitive, if for whenever $y_{ij} = 1$ and $y_{jk} = 1$, we also observe that $y_{ik} = 1$. This follows the logic of `` a friend of a friend is a friend''. Meanwhile, the relationships between $ijk$ are said to be balanced if $y_{ij} \times y_{jk} \times y_{ki} >0$. Conceptually, if the relationship between $i$ and $j$ is ``positive'', then both will relate to another unit $k$ identically, either both positive or both negative. Finally, relationships between $ijk$ are said to be clusterable if it is balanced or all the relations are all negative. It is a relaxation of the concept of balance and seeks to capture groups where the measurements are positive within groups and negative between groups.

Thus third order dependencies suggest that ``knowing something about the relationship between $i$ and $j$ as well as between $i$ and $k$ may reveal something about the relationship between $i$ and $k$, even when we do not directly observe it'' \citep{hoff:2004}. Such dependences would seem especially relevant for our purposes, as one cannot understand the strategic relationship between two countries without taking into account their respective relationships with other countries. The importance for accounting for these dynamics have long been acknowledged in the foreign aid literature. \citet{trumbull:1994} for example, note that, ``donors do make their decisions with knowledge of what each other are doing, and may actually act cooperatively. Any study that ignores the interrelationship of donor behavior risks problems with simultaneity bias.'' However, we find that until now, this critique has largely gone unaddressed by the existing literature. 

The main advantage of calculating the latent space of different dyadic variables as opposed to using alternative specifications such as the S Score algorithm\footnote{\citet{leeds:2007}, for example, measure a states ``threat environment'' as the set of all states for which ones is contiguous with or which is a major power and with an S score below the population median.} is that it allows us to better account for indirect ties that states share. Indirect ties are accounted for within this framework because the latent factor model takes patterns such as transitivity into account, as a result, the relation between two actors can be inferred even if no
direct interaction between them is observed.

We employ this latent factor model on every year for each of our three measures.\footnote{The models are estimated via Gibbs sampling from the full conditional distributions of $\textbf{u}_{i}^{T} \textbf{u}_{j}$. For a more detailed discussion of this model, see \citet{hoff:2005}.} In Figure \ref{fig:polLat}, we present a visualization of the resultant latent space we calculated for each variable for the year 2005.

\end{figure}

\indent\indent Countries that cluster together in this two-dimensional latent space are more likely to interact with each other. The plots for alliances, UN voting and IGO membership suggest that there is distinct clustering among countries. Moreover, these clusters are different across the three measures, suggesting that each variable is indeed capturing different aspects of strategic interest.

\indent\indent After estimating the latent spaces for these components, we estimate the standardized distance between each pair of each countries for the three component. We then combine them in a principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our measure while retaining as much variance as possible. That is, alliances, UN voting and joint membership in IGOs all capture certain aspects of political strategic interest. Instead of choosing only one of them as our measure of strategic interest as other papers have done, we combine them in order to increase our explanatory power. We estimate the PCA of these variables for each year separately\footnote{For each year, we conduct a bootstrap PCA of 1000 subsamples.} and use the first principal component for each year as our measure of strategic interest. On average over all the years, we find that the first component of our PCA of alliances, UN voting and joint membership in IGOs, which we use as our measure of strategic interest, explains about 51\% of its variance. 
For further validation checks of our strategic interest variable, please see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix}.

The end result of this process is a measure of strategic interest that takes into account indirect ties while also accounting for multiple dimensions in which states interact with one another. 

% Our measure of strategic relationships introduces greater coherency to the literaturex by providing a more rigorous measure that captures aspects of strategic interest. We do so by providing a latent space representation of indirect ties that states share on three dimensions: dyadic alliances, UN voting and joint membership in an intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). After generating each latent space representation, we calculate the distances between countries in that space, and then utilize a principal components analysis (PCA) across the distances to generate a single measure.\footnote{As such, our political strategic relationship measure is the first principal component that results from the PCA of the latent distance between each variable.}
