\section*{Reviewer 3}

\subsection*{Major Comments}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Having read the revised manuscript, I feel the authors have adequately addressed both mine and the other reviewers comments. Therefore I am happy to recommend publishing the paper at this stage.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{
		Insert great response.
		}}
	\end{itemize}	
	\item The only point I'd add is that I would encourage the authors to add the additional analyses presented in the referee report into a robustness section or the appendix, to provide readers with information on the conditions under which the results in the main analysis hold.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{
		Insert great response.
