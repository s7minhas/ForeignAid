R1:

1. make specification with lagged dependent variable the main one in the model
  - this will necessitate recreating all of the charts in the paper
2. include fixed effects results in a table in the appendix instead of in a coefficient plot
3. include results using total aid (total aid - humanitarian - civ society) as a column in the paper
4. strat logic stuff that cindy took over
