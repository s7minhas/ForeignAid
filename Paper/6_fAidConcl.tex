\section*{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}


In brief, our preliminary results suggest that political strategic interest does play an important role in positively predicting foreign aid flows, although we find the opposite relationship for military strategic interest. We plan to undertake further work to explore the substantive meaning of our findings and how they may vary over time.

These results should interest us as climate change continues to increase the incidence and the intensity of natural disasters. During this hurricane season alone, residents in the United States have faced the wrath of Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma . Meanwhile, wildfires continue to rage in Northern California. Neither is the rest of the world untouched, as the Mexico City earthquake, flooding in South Asia. \footnote{\url{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/world/asia/floods-south-asia-india-bangladesh-nepal-houston.html?_r=0}}

Meanwhile, to revisit the original illustrative example presented in the introduction, note that though the US' offer and Iran's acceptance of humanitarian aid was a head-turning deviation from the status quo, the swiftness with which both countries reverted back to it was equally remarkable.  Indeed,  following the immediate fallout of the earthquake a couple of weeks later, Iran declined US offers of further humanitarian aid \footnote{``Iran to prosecute over building law breaches in Bam.'' \textit{China Daily.} 3 January 2004. Accessed October 2017: \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20090619204216/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2004-01/03/content_295446.htm}}. Meanwhile, President Bush denied attempts to interpret US aid as evidence of thaw in US-Iran relations.\footnote{\url{http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3362443.stm}}

In this particular case then, the exchange of aid led to only a temporary reprieve from the generally contentious bilateral relations. However, whether aid given exchanged between historically contentious dyads can lead to a more permanent softening of relations remains an open question. We plan to explore this question more fully in future work.
