\section*{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}


In brief, our preliminary results suggest that political strategic interest does play an important role in positively predicting foreign aid flows, although we find the opposite relationship for military strategic interest. We plan to undertake further work to explore the substantive meaning of our findings and how they may vary over time.
