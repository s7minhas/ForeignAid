R1:

1. SM will do this: make specification with lagged dependent variable the main one in the model
  - this will necessitate recreating all of the charts in the paper
2. SM will do this: include fixed effects results in a table in the appendix instead of in a coefficient plot
3. SM + Cindy: include results using total aid (total aid - humanitarian - civ society) as a column in the paper
  - cindy will check to see what the right raw variable is for total aid
  - and then shahryar can run models and incorporate into paper
4. Cindy already did this: strat logic stuff that cindy took over
