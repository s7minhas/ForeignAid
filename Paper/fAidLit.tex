 \section*{Lit Review}
\label{lit}

Scholars have sought to determine the primary motivation for foreign aid at least as far back as the modern foreign aid regime was erected in the post-WWII era. In doing so, they have erected a number of framing devices- i.e. donor interest vs. recipient interest \citep{lumsdaine:1993}, realist vs idealist motivations \citep{schraeder.etal:1998}, donors who give to recipients who practice bad governance or good governance\citep{dollar:2006,neumayer:2005}, donors who give to recipients who implement `bad polices' or `good policies' \citep{alesina:2000} etc.\\

\indent\indent One reason for evaluating the motivations for aid and not aid outcomes is that aid given for strategic reasons may still further development objectives, albeit incidentally, while aid given for humanitarian reasons may also bring unexpected strategic benefits \citep{maizels:1984}. However, evaluating the motivations for aid is not a straightforward process either - any given aid project may work toward providing assistance to a recipient country as well as strategic benefits to a donor country. The question to be answered then is what relative consideration is given to donor interest or humanitarian need when making aid allocation decisions.  At the root of these dichotomies is the suspicion that despite rhetoric to the contrary, foreign aid has been dispersed to address donor interest to a much greater extent than it has been for recipient needs.  \\

\indent\indent  Scholars sought to provide empirical evidence for answer or another since at least as far back as the late 1970's \citep{ mckinlay:1977,mckinlay:1978,mckinley:1979} and onward to the 1980's \citep{maizels:1984} and 1990's \citep{lumsdaine:1993, schraeder.etal:1998}, with scholars finding evidence to suggest that foreign aid allocation is driven by strategic concerns much more than humanitarian ones.  \citet{alesina:2000} were among the first to extend this finding across a large panel of countries, that is to 21 donor countries and 181 recipient countries from 1970-1994. They find that countries that votes relatively more similarly to Japan in the UN are 172\% more likely to receive more aid while Egypt and Israel receive upwards of 400\% more foreign aid than other countries. Ceteris paribus they argue that inefficient, economically closed non-democratic former colonies are much more likely to receive aid than countries that had not been formerly colonized with similar poverty levels, a finding that \citet{alesina:2002} echoes when they find that the US is more likely to give corrupt governments more aid. \citet{berthelemy:2006} reaches a similar conclusion, noting that donor countries are generally much more likely to act based off of egotistic motivations than altruistic ones, while \citet{stone:2006} and \citet{demesquita:2007} find evidence to suggest that donor countries are more likely to use foreign aid to `buy influence.'  \\ 

\indent\indent  While scholars have certainly found variation in their results, the overwhelming consensus is that strategic interest largely takes precedence over humanitarian ones in foreign aid allocation.  Despite this seeming consensus, we find that \citet{alesina:2000}'s remark that  `unfortunately the measurement of what a `strategic interest' is varies from study to study and is occasionaly tautological,' still holds true.  That is, strategic interest has alternately been measured by: trade intensity\citep{bermeo:2008, berthelemy:2004}, UN voting scores \citep{alesina:2000, alesina:2002,dreher:2012}, arms transfers \citep{maizels:1984}, colonial legacy \citep{alesina:2000, bermeo:2008, berthelemy:2004,berthelemy:2006}, alliances \citep{bermeo:2008,schraeder.etal:1998}, regional dummies\citep{bermeo:2008,berthelemy:2006, maizels:1984}, bilateral dummies \citep{alesina:2000, berthelemy:2004, berthelemy:2006}\footnote{A US-Egypt or US-Israel dummy seems to be the most common instance of a bilateral dummy}or some combination of the above. \\

\indent\indent Other papers take a negative approach and argue that any shortfall between what would theoretically be expected from poverty-efficient aid allocation and actual aid allocation\citep{collier:2002,nunnenkamp:2006,thiele:2007}, or similarly between a theoretical allocation based on good governance and actual aid allocation\citep{dollar:2006,neumayer:2005}, is evidence of strategic interest at play. \\

\indent\indent  What's more, what some scholars measure as strategic interest other scholars interpret as a measure of humanitarian interest. As \citet{bermeo:2008} notes for example, there is some controversy in interpreting GDP per capita as a measure of humanitarian aid, as `the poorer a country is, the more it needs aid, and the easier it might be for donors to use aid to influence decisions in the recipient.' She further notes that colonial legacy, a factor that some scholars see as evidence of strategic interest, may not necessarily be an appropriate measure of strategic interest but instead of `strategic development.' In this sense, humanitarian and strategic interests are mutually complementary motivations as donor countries seek to further the development of countries that they have a self-interest in seeing develop. We would further add that increased aid among countries with former colonial ties could also be interpreted as a measurement of the greater degree of cultural understanding between these countries, which has long been argued to be a cornerstone of effective aid. In order to properly evaluate the motivations for foreign aid, what is needed is a better and clearer measure of strategic interest, something which we take up in the next section.\\

\indent\indent  Meanwhile, we note that despite the general consensus that donors are more driven by strategic interests than humanitarian ones, researchers also recognize that there may be significant variation in aid allocation \textit{across time}. In their analysis of 22 donor countries and 137 recipient countries from 1980-1999, \citet{berthelemy:2004} finds that following the Cold War, foreign aid allocation has been more responsive to a good governance and good economic policy in recipient countries, a result that \citet{bermeo:2008} and \citet{dollar:2006}  echoes. This suggests not only that humanitarian need has become more important in recent years but that the relative balance between strategic and humanitarian considerations are not fixed over time. This claim is disputed by \citet{nunnenkamp:2006}'s findings however, whose analysis suggests that foreign aid dispersed from 1981 to 2002 has been \textit{less} targeted to needy countries over time. What these studies hold in common however, is a lack of a \textit{measure} of what they think may be affecting aid allocation across time, only an \textit{interpretation} of what these time effects might mean given their knowledge of the different time periods. \\

\indent\indent  Finally, we similarly note that despite the general consensus that donors are more driven by strategic interests than humanitarian ones, researchers also recognize that there may be significant variation in aid allocation \textit{among different donor countries}. To that end, many papers endeavor to provide an analysis of aid allocation on a cross national level and for individual donor countries \citep{alesina:2000,berthelemy:2006} while other papers choose to focus on the aid allocation strategies of one donor country at a time\citet{bermeo:2008, dreher:2012,mckinlay:1977,mckinlay:1978,neumayer:2003,fleck:2010}. In none of the papers we have encountered however, have scholars sought to evaluate differences in aid allocation in a multi-level hierarchical model. We seek to account for both variation of foreign aid allocations in time and variation across countries in our model specification, which we detail further in the empirical section of this paper. \\


%
%Another is that it is somewhat unclear what they mean - recipient need is defined not in terms of the economic needs of that particular society but the needs of that country relative to the needs of other countries. 
%
%
% 
%Of course two motivations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. By the humanitarian need criterion, donor countries should give exclusively to the poorest countries in the world, and for some scholars, the reason that they do not can only be evidence of strategic tomfoolery. Yet the very measures that scholars have used to measure strategic interest may provide a reasonable explanation to why donor countries do not all give to the poorest recipient countries -physical distance from a particular donor country may mean that it is more efficient to give to countries that are closer

%\subsection*{Variation across countries}
%
%
%
%% A way to see if donors allocation is not independent is to look at how much total aid a country gets per capita? 
%
%\subsection*{Dependence across countries}
%Of course the presumption in these models is that donor giving is completely independent; whether a country receives aid from one donor does not affect whether it receives aid from another donor.  To that end, the presumption  seems to be little coordination among aid donors with better coordination being perceived as enhancing aid effectiveness.  In their investigation of aid allocation from 1956-2006, \citet{aldasoro:2010} find little evidence of increased coordination among aid donors despite rhetoric to improve coordination. \citet{frot:2011} also find that aid donors are likely to 'herd' aid, but find that this effect is substantively small. Exploring a single country, Cambodia, \citet{ohler:2013} also find a lack of evidence for aid coordination among donors. \\ 
%\indent\indent \citet{mascarenhas:2006} find similar evidence of non-cooperation among donors but view this as a positive development. Under their framework, foreign aid is a public good and the extent to which donors derive donor-specific benefit from giving foreign aid (and thus give more than what one might expect given the possibility to free-ride), non cooperation among aid donors boosts much need foreign aid for recipients (instead of increasing redundancy and reducing efficiency as implied by \citet{aldasoro:2010} and \citet{frot:2011} )\\
%
% \indent\indent Meanwhile \citet{steinwand:2014} argue that donors do in fact coordinate under some conditions. Namely they present the idea of 'lead donorship', wherein a recipient has one major donor country and argue that this is more likely to occur when there are large oil exports to donor countries, large imports from donor countries and a colonial history.\footnote{\citet{steinwand:2014} also develop a framework wherein the cross tabs between lead donorship and the existence of coordination indicates whether aid is seen primarily as a private good or public good in a particular situation. } \\
%\indent\indent  \citet{fuchs:2013} explore why donors do not better coordinate the allocation of foreign aid. They find evidence to suggest that competition for export markets and political supports prevents coordination and thus implicitly make an argument for why foreign aid allocation is indeed independent across donor countries.  \citet{lawson:2013} also argues competing objectives as well as division of labor problems among donors prevents coordination.
%\indent\indent  Moreover \citet{frot:2010} find high fragmentation of aid across sectors. They find that in general, countries that are poor, democratic and have a large population are likely to have more fragmented aid though this is only because they are likely to attract more donors. Once these effects are controlled for, democratic and poor countries are no more likely to recieve aid then their authoritarian and rich counterparts. \\

%\subsection*{Methods and Models} 
%
%\subsubsection*{Operationalizing the DV}
%\citet{trumbull:1994} operationalize the dependent variable as $log ( \frac{i\text{'s per capita ODA in year } t}{\text{sample average ODA for year }t})$ where $i$ denotes the recipient country.\\
%
%\citet{dreher:2012} operationalize the dependent variable as $\frac{i\text{'s ODA recieved from China in year} t}{\text{China's total aid in year }t}$ where $i$ denotes the recipient country.
%
%
%Committment or Disbursement?
%A number of authors \citep{aldasoro:2010,neumayer:2005,berthelemy:2006} use aid committments over actual disbursements of aid reasoning that donors have full control of committments only. Disbursements are seen as partly depending on whether the prospective recipient country actually requests the commitment, which for a number of reasons (that they don't give examples of) sometimes is not the case. Disbursements may also in part rely on the recipient country's capacity to recieve aid. 
%
%
%
%Meanwhile other authors \citep{alesina:2002,alesina:2000,kuziemko:2006,fleck:2010} use various measures of disbursed ODA though none seem to give a particular justification why. 
%
%
%\citet{alesina:2002} use net ODA per capita\citet{alesina:2000} uses log of net ODA, though neither give a particular justification as to why.  \citet{acharya:2006} also uses aid disbursements but they argue from the point of view of the recipients.
%
%Gross or net?
%
%\citet{neumayer:2005} and \citet{mcgillivray:1992} argue that one should use gross ODA to a recipient country as a percentage of total gross ODA dispersed by the donor country as this more accurately reflects donor the weight that the donor gives to the recipient country. They argue that while the donor may take into account the population of the recipient country in its disbursements, this is merely one outcome of the process of dividing the aid pie, not its main consideration.

%\citet{neumayer:2003} uses a two-step Heckman selection model. The first stage is the gate-keeping stage where it is determined which countries recieve aid; the second stage is a level stage where it is determined how much aid a country receives given that they receive any aid. In the Heckman two step estimator, the error terms of both stages are allowed to be correlated however it requries an exclusionary variable that is associated with the gatekeeping stage but not the level stage. \citet{neumayer:2003} uses the total amount of aid allocated in any given year as his exclusionary variable, arguing that the higher amount of total aid allocation increases the chances of receiving any aid at all. He notes that this variable is an imperfect one at best.

While giving foreign aid in the wake of a natural disaster can be relatively cleanly classified as being a result of a humanitarian impulse rather than an economic one, giving foreign aid to build schools or hospitals can be equally interpreted as either being motivated by humanitarian/moral reasons or being motivated by developmental/economic ones.

%A great number of scholars have puzzled over the motivations for foreign aid. Some exceptions withstanding (Bermeo 2006), most scholars have found that 
%
%
%Strategic and humanitarian motives are hard to parse out because they are so idiosyncratic. For example, a not inconsiderable number of papers include a Egypt or Israel dummy (Alesina and Dollar 2000, Berthelemy 2005) in their models to capture the strategic importance of these countrie. While this variable is often to be significant, it is unclear why these particular sets of countries are chosen when other donor-recipient relations may be described in equally idiosyncratic terms (insert example).  Scholar also insert other variables such as colonial history or UN voting to capture strategic motives 
% 
%We propose to assess the respective importance of strategic or humanitarian motives by investigating whether the global level of military tension is influential in a donor country's foreign aid decisions. In doing so, we introduce a novel variable to measure strategic interest. Should donor countries increase foreign aid giving in response to rising levels of strategic tensions, this provides strong evidence that countries are motivated by strategic interests when giving aid. Meanwhile, a null relationship between strategic aid and foreign aid would provide some, though not definitive evidence that donor countries ignore strategic considerations when dispersing aid.

%\subsection*{Why and When do Countries Give Foreign Aid?} 
%In this literature review, I give a brief overview of the different potential reasons that donor countries distribute foreign aid as explored by existing literature. Note that for the most part, these reasons tend to be tied to characteristics of the recipient country rather than characteristics of the donor countries. I then attempt to document how different scholars have operationalized these different potential motivations and their modelling strategy (to the extent that the modeling strategy may be methodologically interesting to consider for our purposes).\\
%\indent\indent In general, it seems that there is no clear delineation between the different possible motivations for foreign aid. For example, in their review of the foreign aid literature, \citet{schraeder.etal:1998} identify 6 possible motivations for foreign aid giving: humanitarian reasons (as measured by average life expectancy and daily caloric intake) , strategic importance, economic potential (that is, if the recipient country is deemed to be most economically strong in the region, the implication being that the better their economy does, the better the donor economy's does), cultural similarity (as measured by colonial history), ideological stance, regional similarity (if countries are similar to each other, donors may use a similar foreign aid strategy for all of them). However it may be impossible to uniquely identify any one of these different measures from the other. Cultural similarity can bleed into regional similarity for example, or strategic importance and economic potential may be endogenous to each other. \\
%\indent\indent  What this means in practice is that it is often not clearly defined what the authors are seeking to explain when they throw in different variables into their regressions. They way in which the work below is categorized below then is not strictly how the authors themselves would categorize them, but how they might reasonably fit together given the vagueness and variation across the field. 
% 
%
%\subsubsection*{Objective Need:Humanitarian/Moral Motivations/Economic Motivations}
% 
%\citet{lumsdaine:1993} makes a strong case for the `moral vision' being a driving factor in aid distribution. He also makes a case for foreign aid being a function of the colonial history, democratic status, and the income levels of a country.\footnote{ However, as \citet{alesina:2000} note, he presents only simple correlations in his analysis and as such does not provide robust evidence for his theory}  \\
%\indent\indent Meanwhile, using a cross national panel analysis, \citet{trumbull:1994} explore the extent to which foreign aid is given as a function of material physical security. They find that infant mortality (their measure of physical security) is associated with increased foreign aid. They further find that GNP per capita  (their measure of material security) is \textit{not} associated with increased foreign aid.

%\subsubsection*{Strategic Motivations}
%
%\citet{maizels:1984}  find evidence to suggest that countries give aid for strategic interests.  Restricting their analysis to African countries, \citet{schraeder.etal:1998} also reject an altruistic motivation for donors.
%To that end, \citet{alesina:2000} also find that countries with a colonial past and political alliances\footnote{As measured by UN voting alliances}  to the sender are much more likely to receive foreign aid
%
%\citet{kuziemko:2006} find that nonpermanent members of the UN Security Council\footnote{10 of the 15 seats on the UNSC are held for non renewable 2 year terms} experience temporary increases in foreign aid when they serve on the Council.\\

%\subsubsection*{Ideological Reasons}
%
%Ideological motivations for sending foreign aid can in some ways be seen as a combination of humanitarian and strategic reasons. For example, if one frames the conflict between the US and USSR during the Cold War as an ideological struggle, the respective desires of each side to ensure the ideological allegiance of third party countries was as much a function of strategic reasons (i.e as illustrated in the policy of containment) as well as a function of humanitarian ones (i.e. the idea that capitalism/democracy was an inherently morally and politically superior system to communism or vice versa). \\
%\indent\indent To this end, \citet{alesina:2000} find that countries that democratize  (as measured by Freedom House) receive more aid with relatively more democratic countries receive 39 percent more aid. They find evidence to suggest that countries pay more attention to democracy strictly defined then broader definition of civil rights or law enforcement.\footnote{They find that US, Dutch, UK, the Nordic countries and Canada conform to this description while Germany and Japan only weakly conform to this description; France does not} This provides an interesting contrast to their finding for FDI which concentrates on rule of law but insensitive to democratic institutions They argue that in general FDI is more sensitive to economic incentives than foreign aid which responds more the political variablesUsing a cross national panel analysis, \citet{trumbull:1994} also explore the extent to which foreign aid is given as a function of political rights. They find that an increase the political and civil rights (as measured by a precursor to the Freedom House index) is associated with an increase in foreign aid. \\
%\indent\indent  \citet{alesina:1999} do not find that less corrupt governments receive more foreign aid. However they do find that individual donor countries do vary in terms of how much they give to corrupt governments. They find that Scandinavian countries and Australia give more to less corrupt governments while the US gives more to more corrupt governments. \citet{berthelemy:2006} finds that on average, donors act for political or commercial reasons. However, contrary to \citet{alesina:1991}, they  also tend to give aid to countries with better governance indicators, less conflict and higher growth.

%No shortage of scholars have sought to understand a donor country's motivation for giving foreign aid. Are donor countries primarily motivated by strategic interest? Or is foreign aid better characterized as being given for humanitarian reasons? Perhaps one reason why no satisfactory answer to this question has been found is because these motivations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Take the recent outbreak of ebola in West Africa for instance -  while increasing foreign assistance to recipient countries undoubtedly assists West African countries in combatting a humanitarian crisis, it also brings strategic benefit to donor countries in that it increases the likelihood of containing ebola to recipient countries.
%
%Given the mutability of these two motivations, the best scholars can do is to determine whether on average,  countries are more motivated by strategic or humanitarian reasons. Yet the literature to date has not asked this question. Instead, scholars have sought to ask whether individual donor countries are more motivated to give to donor countries for strategic or humanitarian reasons. While the US may be more motivated by strategic interests, Sweden and Norway may not be, the question is on the whole which way does the scale tip?  Morever in evaluating these different motivations, scholars have largely used variables which can be interpreted as being done for both. For example, while some scholars argue that giving to poorer recipient countries is an indication of a humanitarian impulse, other scholars argue that this can be just as likely to be interpreted as given for strategic reasons as influence is likewise `cheaper' in poorer countries.

%1. There has been a lot of literature trying to parse out the reasons why countries give foreign aid. The two opposing motivations can be broadly described as realist/strategic or idealist/humanitarian.
%2. However the consensus as to which motivation is more dominant is lacking. Literature promoting the realist view includes - Alesina and Dollar (2000) Stone (2006), Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2007) Shraeder. Literature promoting the idealist view includes Bermeo (2008)
%Shortcomings - empirically - individual donor countries versus panel data - by conducting regressions of each donor country separately, you're not accounting for the fact that the foreign aid given by other countries may influence the foreign aid you give. Certainly this is something important for any country to consider whether they are dispersing foreign aid for strategic or humanitarian reasons. 
%
%
% This paper seeks to address this question in a much more comprehensive way by i) allowing our empirical model to consider the motivations of all donor countries via panel data, as opposed to breaking the model down by individual model and ii) evaluating whether the global level of strategic tension affects foreign aid giving as opposed to only considering bilateral strategic interests.

%\indent\indent To the extent that the current literature explores variation across donor countries, the literature suggests that different donors may be more motivated by some goals relative to others. \citet{schraeder.etal:1998} find for example that Japanese aid is more likely to be motivated by economic and trade interests, Swedish aid supports progressive, socialist-minded regimes and France's aid is almost exclusively targeted toward francophone countries \citep{werker:2012}. \citet{berthelemy:2006} finds that the Noridc countries, along with Switzerland and Ireland are more prone to be altruistic than other donors. \\
%\indent\indent Focusing solely on aid allocation in the Arab world, \citet{neumayer:2003} finds that OPEC donors favor other Arab and non-Arab Muslim recipients.  Countries that do not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel or with voting patterns similar to Saudi Arabia are also more likely to get more aid. He finds that donor interest, in particular Arab solidarity, is a strong determinant in whether a country gets aid and how much while recipient need (as measured by a country's level of income) only affects if the country gets aid, not how much aid they get. \\
%\indent\indent Focusing solely on China, \citet{dreher:2012} find that political and commercial considerations shape China's aid allocation. However they find that compared to other countries, China does not pay substantially more attention to politics nor do thy find evidence that China's aid allocation is motivated by natural resource concerns.\footnote{Note however that many projects that could be categorized as foreign aid is often doled out in the form of FDI.} In general they argue that China's aid allocation seems to be independent of democracy and governance considerations in recipient countries.\\
%\indent\indent \citet{fleck:2010} investigate how the motivations for US aid have evolved over time. They find evidence to suggest that i) the probability of receiving US foreign aid before and following the War on terror increased with the level of development. Higher-developed countries were more likely to receive aid at all, but this did not necessarily come at the expense of lower developed countries as the overall aid budget also increased  following the War on Terror ii) the level of US aid for the US' core foreign aid countries has been less a function of need following the War on Terror than before.
