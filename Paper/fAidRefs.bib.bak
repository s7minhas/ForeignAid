  title = {Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth},
  journal = {Handbook of economic growth},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {385--472},
  abstract = {This paper develops the empirical and theoretical case that differences
	in economic in- stitutions are the fundamental cause of differences
	in economic development. We first document the empirical importance
	of institutions by focusing on two “quasi-natural ex- periments”
	in history, the division of Korea into two parts with very different
	economic institutions and the colonization of much of the world by
	European powers starting in the fifteenth century. We then develop
	the basic outline of a framework for thinking about why economic
	institutions differ across countries. Economic institutions deter-
	mine the incentives of and the constraints on economic actors, and
	shape economic outcomes. As such, they are social decisions, chosen
	for their consequences. Because different groups and individuals
	typically benefit from different economic institutions, there is
	generally a conflict over these social choices, ultimately resolved
	in favor of groups with greater political power. The distribution
	of political power in society is in turn determined by political
	institutions and the distribution of resources. Political in- stitutions
	allocate de jure political power, while groups with greater economic
	might typically possess greater de facto political power. We therefore
	view the appropriate theoretical framework as a dynamic one with
	political institutions and the distribution of resources as the state
	variables. These variables themselves change over time be- cause
	prevailing economic institutions affect the distribution of resources,
	and because groups with de facto political power today strive to
	change political institutions in order to increase their de jure
	political power in the future. Economic institutions encourag- ing
	economic growth emerge when political institutions allocate power
	to groups with interests in broad-based property rights enforcement,
	when they create effective con- straints on power-holders, and when
	there are relatively few rents to be captured by power-holders. We
	illustrate the assumptions, the workings and the implications of
	this framework using a number of historical examples.},

  abstract = {Among countries colonized by European powers during the past 500 years,
	those that were relatively rich in 1500 are now relatively poor.
	We document this reversal using data on urbanization patterns and
	population density, which, we argue, proxy for economic prosperity.
	This reversal weighs against a view that links economic development
	to geographic factors. Instead, we argue that the reversal reflects
	changes in the institutions resulting from European colonialism.
	The European intervention appears to have created an "institutional
	reversal" among these societies, meaning that Europeans were more
	likely to introduce institutions encouraging investment in regions
	that were previously poor. This institutional reversal accounts for
	the reversal in relative incomes. We provide further support for
	this view by documenting that the reversal in relative incomes took
	place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
	and resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage
	of the opportunity to industrialize.},

	sensitive to economic incentives than foreign aid which responds
	more the political variables
	
	-Literature
	
	oEffects: 
	
	•Jepma (1997) conlucdes that foreign aid crowds out private saving,
	supports public consumption and has no significant impact on recipeients
	mcroeconomic policies and growth? chicken or egg problem? 
	
	•Cross country growth empirics: Boone (1994, 1996) foregin aid does
	not affect investment and growth; Burnside and Dollar find that aid
	is beneicial to countries that adopt appropriate and stable policies
	and is otherwise wasted and no evidence of endogeneity. Collier and
	Dollar (1998) show that under certain assumtptions, the allocation
	of aid that has the maximum effect on poverty reduction is a function
	of the recipeients level of poverty and quality of economic policies
	
	oCauses:
	
	•Lurnsdaime(1993), moral vision, colonial history, democratic status,
	income levels, though only through correlation
	
	•No idealism: Maizels and Nissanke (1984) , Schrader Hook and Taylor
	(1998)
	
	•Biliateral and multilateral aid very different
	
	Country Specific Results, ceteris paribus
	
	-No sig relationship in religion except for other relgions
	
	-More open countries receive about 20 percent more aid (in sd)
	
	oOpenness still more important for FDI
	
	-Relatively more democratic countries receive 39 percent more aid
	
	oCountries pay more attention to democracy strictly defined then broader
	definition of civil rights or law enforcuement; interesting contrast
	to FDI which concentrates on rule of law but insensitive to democratic
	institutions
	
	•US, Duthc, UK, Nordics and Canada care more about this, France doesn’t
	and Germany and Japan put a small weight on this
	
	-Countries with relatively long colonial past receives 87 percent
	more aid
	
	-Allies receive more aid
	
	oThis measured through UN friends, argued that UN votes don’t really
	matter so not an explanation of bribery then allies
	
	-US policy concentrated in Egypt and Israel
	
	-Friends of Japan receive more aid while US friends do not because
	of above
	
	-France does not give based on income, Nordic countries followed by
	Nordic countries do
	
	Do shocks cause countries to give?
	
	-In reaction to decreases in democracy: Countries tend to reduce aid
	but not as by as large a percentage as they increase aid in response
	to positive change in democracy? There is a tendency for bilateral
	donors to reward countries that democratize
	
	-In about 75% of trade liberalization, aid increases until about 3
	years out when it goes back to the same level},

  abstract = {I show that the process of democratization in developing countries
	constitutes an important factor in the formation of preferential
	trade agreements. Specifically, democratizing developing countries
	are more likely to form a preferential trade agreement with richer
	countries, whereas there is little evidence that democratic transition
	affects the probability of a developing country joining a preferential
	trade agreement with other developing countries. This result follows
	naturally from median voter preferences and the Heckscher–Ohlin and
	Stolper–Samuelson theorems. Put simply, the median voter gains from
	trading with the richer states and loses from trading with the other
	poor states. Since preferential trade agreements allow countries
	to wave the most-favored nation principle, the need for both trade
	openness and protectionism against competitors might explain why
	preferential trade agreements constitute one of the main features
	of the current wave of globalization. I quantitatively test this
	hypothesis using a newly compiled dataset that covers 135 developing
	countries from 1990 to 2007. An important implication of this article
	is that it could be more challenging than expected to combine domestic
	political equality with international economic equality.},

	proposition holds when economic integration is operationalized as
	foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks, inflows, and outflows. The
	results for the years 1980—2000 indicate that inflows and stock of
	foreign investment reduce the risk of an outbreak of a fatal dispute,

	equation model. Thus, reverse causality does not bias the pacifying
	effect of foreign investment inflows and stock. The results also
	support the underlying notion of the commercial peace that militarized
	conflicts inhibit foreign investment. The onset of a fatal conflict
	reduces FDI inflows, and, if tested in a two-stage instrumental variable
	approach, FDI stock, the most complete measure of economic integration
	through foreign investment. Accounting for endogeneity seems particularly
	important when analyzing the link between the onset of fatal disputes

	direct investment (FDI) flows from the perspective of the “eclectic
	theory” of international investment, and hence the advantages of
	foreign ownership, host country location, and internationalization.
	Host country policies can influence FDI flows primarily through their
	influence on the advantages of location in the host country. Pooled
	cross-section and time-series data for 49 less-developed countries
	(LDCs) over 1970–95 are used to examine the effects of several different
	types of policy/institutional variables, including corporate tax
	rates, tariff rates, the degree of openness to international capital
	flows, exchange rate distortions, contract enforcement, nationalization
	risk, bureaucratic delay and corruption. A multivariate analysis
	of the effects on FDI flows of each type of policy, with and without
	controls for other relevant determinants is conducted. Two different
	sources of FDI data are employed as well as two different measures
	of capital controls. Although there are methodological problems in
	estimation, and especially collinearity problems, and relatively
	severe availability constraints for some of the relevant measures,
	the results demonstrate the relevance and importance for FDI flows
	of many of the policy/institutional variables under study. They also
	indicate that the results from panel methods yield results that differ
	rather significantly from those obtained from pure cross-section
	analysis. Because of complementarity between the various elements
	of a healthy investment climate, the effects of some policy reforms
	estimated from models which do not control for changes in other policies
	may overstate the effectiveness of individual policy reforms.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to examine the role of geography in
	explaining the patterns of financial and economic integration among
	both developed and developing countries. Using a gravity model, we
	compare North-North, North-South and South-North FDI, trade and portfolio
	investment flows to examine how geographical factors influence these
	bilateral flows. The results indicate that the impact of geography
	variables on FDI and portfolio are similar to their effect on trade.
	Geography variables have a statistically significant effect both
	on FDI and portfolio investment, but FDI is more sensitive to distance.
	We interpret the negative effect of distance as the existence of
	information costs in financial flows. Also bilateral FDI, trade and
	portfolio investment flows react to macroeconomic fundamentals in
	the same way, however, with different degrees of sensitivity. There
	are significant differences between North-North and North-South flows.
	Our results find support for the argument that most FDI among industrial
	countries are horizontal, whereas most FDI investment in developing
	countries is vertical. The fact that the significance of geographical
	variables on financial flows still remained even after controlling
	for the macroeconomic fundamentals, is in contrast with the standard
	capital market model. The results can, however, be reconciled if
	geographical factors can proxy for information costs, which may in
	turn explain why country portfolios are still home-biased. The significant
	effect of distance on financial flows may also explain how idiosyn
	cratic shocks are spread (i.e. contagion) to other countries in the
	same region. Ultimately, the geographical location of a country may
	determine its economic and financial integration into the world economy.},

  abstract = {Two studies question whether economic interdependence promotes peace,
	arguing that previous research has not adequately considered the
	endogeneity of trade. Using simultaneous equations to capture the
	reciprocal effects, they report that trade does not reduce conflict,
	though conflict reduces trade. These results are puzzling on logical
	grounds. Trade should make conflict less likely, ceteris paribus,
	if interstate violence adversely affects commerce; otherwise, national
	leaders are acting irrationally. In re-analyzing the authors’ data,
	this article shows that trade does promote peace once the gravity
	model is incorporated into the analysis of conflict. Both trade and
	conflict are influenced by nations’ sizes and the distance separating
	them, so these fundamental exogenous factors must be included in
	models of conflict as well as trade. One study errs in omitting distance
	when explaining militarized disputes. The other does not adequately
	control for the effect of size (or power). When these theoretically
	informed changes are made, the pacific benefit of trade again appears.
	In new simultaneous analyses, the article confirms that trade promotes
	peace and conflict contemporaneously reduces commerce, even with
	extensive controls for traders’ rational expectations of violence.
	Previous studies that address the endogeneity of trade by controlling
	for the years of peace — as virtually all have done since 1999 —
	have not overstated the benefit of interdependence. Commerce promotes
	peace because violence has substantial costs, whether these are paid
	prospectively or contemporaneously.},

  journal = {Journal of Conflict Resolution},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Bilateral investment treaties (BITs), agreements that provide extensive
	rights and protection to foreign investors, were first adopted in
	the 1960s, proliferated in the late 1980s and 1990s, especially among
	developing countries, and seemingly fell out of fashion after 2001.
	To explain this life cycle of diffusion across the international
	state system, we argue that BIT signing followed a traditional logic
	of diffusion for an innovation albeit here in the policy realm. In
	the first period, BITs provided a solution to the time inconsistency
	problem facing host governments and foreign investors. In the second
	period, these treaties became the global standard governing foreign
	investment. As the density of BITs among peer countries increased,
	more countries signed them in order to gain legitimacy and acceptance
	without a full understanding of their costs and competencies. More
	recently, as the potential legal liabilities involved in BIT signing
	have become more broadly understood, the pattern of adoption has
	reverted to a more competitive and rational logic. Our empirical
	tests of BIT signing over four decades provide evidence for such
	a three-stage model.},

	With that prospect in mind, this article examines the policy change

	between a combined set of domestic and international events and the
	Australian policy change. Second, it examines the direct causal factor—comprising
	the 2010 recommendations by the Australian Productivity Commission—in
	detail. Specifically, this part of the article focuses on the framing

	utility of investment disciplines. It uncovers problematic assumptions

	less committed to cooperation will not. The recent enlargement of
	NATO to include the former Warsaw Pact members Poland, Hungary, and
	the Czech Republic illustrates this logic. The potential candidates

	civilian control over the military, and the resolution of border
	and ethnic disputes with neighbors. These criteria served to identify
	the more cooperative potential members and to encourage cooperative
	behavior among those who aspired to membership. However, NATO enlargement
	came at a price. Although trust was built and cooperation fostered
	between the East European states that gained membership, trust was
	broken and cooperation harmed between NATO and Russia. This unfortunate
	outcome represents a dilemma that arises in the expansion of a security

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to examine the role of geography in
	explaining the patterns of financial and economic integration among
	both developed and developing countries. Using a gravity model, we
	compare North-North, North-South and South-North FDI, trade and portfolio
	investment flows to examine how geographical factors influence these
	bilateral flows. The results indicate that the impact of geography
	variables on FDI and portfolio are similar to their effect on trade.
	Geography variables have a statistically significant effect both
	on FDI and portfolio investment, but FDI is more sensitive to distance.
	We interpret the negative effect of distance as the existence of
	information costs in financial flows. Also bilateral FDI, trade and
	portfolio investment flows react to macroeconomic fundamentals in
	the same way, however, with different degrees of sensitivity. There
	are significant differences between North-North and North-South flows.
	Our results find support for the argument that most FDI among industrial
	countries are horizontal, whereas most FDI investment in developing
	countries is vertical. The fact that the significance of geographical
	variables on financial flows still remained even after controlling
	for the macroeconomic fundamentals, is in contrast with the standard
	capital market model. The results can, however, be reconciled if
	geographical factors can proxy for information costs, which may in
	turn explain why country portfolios are still home-biased. The significant
	effect of distance on financial flows may also explain how idiosyn
	cratic shocks are spread (i.e. contagion) to other countries in the
	same region. Ultimately, the geographical location of a country may
	determine its economic and financial integration into the world economy.},

	I seek to shed light on the striking institutional differences among

	and more frequently to private international courts, such as the
	International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
	Commerce or the London Court of International Arbitration, as well
	as recourse to so-called ad hoc arbitration and alternative dispute-resolution
	techniques, such as conciliation and mediation. The key institutional
	dimensions along which these methods of international dispute resolution
	vary are (1) procedural and adaptive flexibility, and (2) centralization
	of procedural safeguards and information collection. I explain why
	different methods of international commercial dispute resolution
	are selected. I argue that these methods respond to the varying institutional
	needs of different types of disputes and disputants. Such needs can
	be explained in terms of the severity of the enforcement problem,
	uncertainty about the preferences or behavior of contractual partners,
	and uncertainty about the state of the world.},

	how party discipline affects which industries receive tariff protection
	from foreign imports. I develop a theoretical framework and generate
	a set of testable predictions. Highly disciplined parties in majoritarian
	systems offer trade policies favorable to voters in marginal districts.
	At the margin, electorally consolidated industries located in marginal
	districts will be highly protected. However, in majoritarian systems
	with low party discipline, the model predicts tariff protection will
	favor large, electorally dispersed industries. Industries concentrated
	in marginal districts are expected to be the least favorably protected.
	Regression analysis is used on data from the 1970s on industry tariffs
	levels and industry employment levels across electoral districts
	in the United States and Canada. The findings generally support the
	theoretical model. In Canada, industries highly concentrated in marginal
	districts receive the most favorable levels of protection. In the
	United States, industries located in safe districts receive more
	favorable levels of protection than industries located in marginal
	districts. Although electorally concentrated industries receive higher
	levels of protection, on average, than electorally decentralized
	industries; in the United States large, electorally dispersed industries

	The ratification process screens out some states that do not intend

	violations is addressed by making states responsible for punishing
	the actions of their own soldiers. By protecting POWs, the treaties
	help states raise armies during wartime. The POW case supports many,
	but not all, of the Rational Design conjectures. In particular, it
	suggests other strategic logics to explain variation in the membership

	occurs when a state negotiates with several other states at the same
	time. Clustering enables states to avoid having to make concessions
	on the same issue to one state after another, and therefore has important
	distributional advantages. Clustering also centralizes bargaining
	within a regime, especially when several states cluster simultaneously
	in a "macro-cluster." I propose several hypotheses about clustering.
	First, most-favored-nation (MFN) clauses are a necessary condition
	for clustering. They link the distributional conflicts among many
	pairs of countries and make centralized bargaining more likely. Second,
	increasing membership in the trade regime makes clustering more likely.
	This relationship between membership and centralization echoes Rational
	Design conjecture C3, CENTRALIZATION increases with NUMBER, though
	the causal mechanism differs significantly. Third, clustering provides
	distributional advantages to those who cluster. A state that clusters,
	such as France under the Méline tariff or Germany under Chancellors
	Leo von Caprivi and Bernard von Bülow, will make fewer concessions

	science has gone hand-in-hand with increased attention paid to the
	choice of estimation technique. In comparison, specification choice
	has been relatively neglected, even though it leads to equally, if
	not more, serious inference problems. In this article four specification
	issues are analysed. It is argued that to avoid biased estimates
	of the spatial effects, researchers need to consider carefully how
	to model temporal dynamics, common trends and common shocks, as well
	as how to account for spatial clustering and unobserved spatial heterogeneity.
	The remaining two specification issues relate to the weighting matrix
	employed for the creation of spatial effects: whether it should be
	row-standardised and what functional form to choose for this matrix.
	The importance of these specification issues is demonstrated by replicating
	Hays' model of spatial dependence in international capital tax rate
	competition. Seemingly small changes to model specification have
	major impacts on the spatial effect estimates. It is recommended
	that spatial analysts develop their theories of spatial dependencies
	further to provide more guidance on the specification of the estimation
	model. In the absence of sufficiently developed theories, the robustness
	of results to specification changes needs to be demonstrated.},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {Dyadic (state-pair) data is completely inappropriate for analyzing
	multilateral events (such as large alliances and major wars). Scholars,
	particularly in international relations, often divide the actors
	in a multilateral event into a series of dyadic relations. Though
	this practice can dramatically increase the size of data sets, using
	dyadic data to analyze what are, in reality, k-adic events leads
	to model misspecification and, inevitably, statistical bias. In short,
	one cannot recover a k-adic data generating process using dy-adic
	data. In this paper, I accomplish three tasks. First, I use Monte
	Carlo simulations to confirm that analyzing k-adic events with dyadic
	data produces substantial bias. Second, I show that choice-based
	sampling, as popularized by King and Zeng (2001a, Explaining rare
	events in international relations. International Organization 55:693–715,
	and 2001b, Logistic regression in rare events data. Political Analysis
	9:137–63), can be used to create feasibly sized k-adic data sets.
	Finally, I use the study of alliance formation by Gibler and Wolford
	(2006, Alliances, then democracy: An examination of the relationship
	between regime type and alliance formation. The Journal of Conflict
	Resolution 50:1–25) to illustrate how to apply this choice-based
	sampling solution and explain how to code independent variables in
	a k-adic context.},

	and catch up with economic leaders. It is therefore important to
	understand why some countries attract more investments by multinationals
	than others. We expand the set of common determinants of FDI with
	urban agglomerations and ask the question whether the accessibility
	of market potential and the number of potential investment locations,
	in the shape of urban concentrations, matters, since the importance
	of urban agglomeration economies for FDI has not been investigated
	before. We show that countries with several medium-sized cities attract
	more foreign investment, especially if they are close to main agglomerations,
	but too much concentration (primacy) reduces the inflow of FDI. Moreover,
	we unbundle spatially lagged FDI by including spatial lags of the
	determinants of FDI. It is important to disentangle such third-country
	effects in order to understand how FDI flows depend on the complex
	ways in which multinationals fragment sales and production across
	countries. Using a panel of U.S. affiliates’ sales in foreign countries
	between 1984 and 1998, we find evidence that cities are important
	drivers of FDI. Furthermore, third-country effects suggest that horizontal
	and complex forms of FDI coexist.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyse the regional distribution
	of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Spain and its main determinants
	between 1995 and 2005/2008. By means of using different indicators,
	the paper reveals the major traits of this distribution, among which
	its highly geographical concentration stands out. Afterwards, the
	paper performs an explanatory factor analysis to reduce to a manageable
	number of factors the vast array of FDI determinants considered in
	the literature. The econometric analysis carried out reveals that
	factors such as economic potential, labour conditions and competitiveness
	are important for attracting FDI both at aggregate and sectoral levels;
	on the contrary, market size is not relevant at all as booster of
	FDI. Finally, the analysis is extended to take account of the presence
	of spatial effects, the results showing the existence of negative
	geographical spillovers associated to the economic potential and
	competitiveness factors.},

  abstract = {The Rational Design project is impressive on its own terms. However,
	it does not address other approaches relevant to the design of international
	institutions. To facilitate comparison I survey two "contrast spaces"
	around it. The first shares the project's central question-What explains
	institutional design?-but addresses alternative explanations of two
	types: rival explanations and explanations complementary but deeper
	in the causal chain. The second contrast begins with a different
	question: What kind of knowledge is needed to design institutions
	in the real world? Asking this question reveals epistemological differences
	between positive social science and institutional design that can
	be traced to different orientations toward time. Making institutions
	is about the future and has an intrinsic normative element. Explaining
	institutions is about the past and does not necessarily have this
	normative dimension. To avoid "driving with the rearview mirror"
	we need two additional kinds of knowledge beyond that developed in
	this volume, knowledge about institutional effectiveness and knowledge
	about what values to pursue. As such, the problem of institutional
	design is a fruitful site for developing a broader and more practical
	conception of social science that integrates normative and positive
	concerns.},
