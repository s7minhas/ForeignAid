\subsection*{Estimation Method}

To model aid flows using our directed-dyadic panel dataset, we utilize a hierarchical model. We include random intercepts in our model for every dyad and year. More concretely, we fit the following model: 

\begin{align*}
  Log(Aid)_{sr,t} &= \beta_{1}(Pol. \; Strat.  \; Distance_{sr,t-1})  \\
  & \;+\; \beta_{2}(Colony_{sr,t-1}) \;+\; \beta_{3}(Polity_{r,t-1}) \\
  & \;+\; \beta_{4}Log(GDP \; per \; capita_{r,t-1}) \;+\; \beta_{5}(Life \;Expect_{r,t-1}) \\  
  & \;+\; \beta_{6}(No. \; Disasters_{r,t-1}) \;+\; \beta_{7}(Civil \; War_{r,t-1}) \\
  & \;+\; \beta_{8}(Pol. \; Strat.  \; Interest_{sr,t-1} \times No. \; Disasters_{r,t-1}) \\
   & \;+\; \delta_{s,r}  \;+\; \rho_{t} \\
\end{align*}

\noindent Where $\delta_{s,r}$ and $\rho_t$ are the sender and receiver random effects respectively. %\footnote{Note, to examine the model results without the interaction effects, please see Figure \ref{fig:nointCoef} in Appendix \ref{app:rawModels}}

The results of this analysis are shown below in a coefficient plot in Figure \ref{fig:intCoef}. We test Hypotheses 1A, 1B and 1C using ``Humanitarian Aid'' as the dependent variable. The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between the interaction of \textit{Strategic Distance} and the \textit{No. Disasters}. To interpret these results, we turn to Figure \ref{fig:simEffects} (``Humanitarian Aid'' panel) where we plot the substantive effect of this interaction term on humanitarian aid over the range of \textit{Strategic Distance} for different levels of natural disaster severity.

These results suggest that the greater the number of natural disasters a country experiences, the more likely it is to receive humanitarian aid from a strategic adversary. This is apparent in the rising slope between strategic interest and humanitarian aid as the number of natural disasters increases. As such, these results are consistent with H1C, which suggests that donors may be more likely to dispense humanitarian aid to their strategic adversaries because such disasters present unique opportunities to improve bilateral relations. Notably when natural disasters are particularly severe, donors may dispense a great deal more aid to strategic opponents compared to strategic allies to further their strategic interests.  

Conversely, support for H1A is missing. In particular, we would have expected there be a downward sloping relationship between strategic interest and humanitarian aid when there are no natural disasters. However, if natural disasters had a humanizing effect on strategic opponents, then we would have expected the slope between strategic interest and humanitarian aid to flatten as the number of natural disasters increased, which we do not find. 

Support for H1B is also lacking.  To find support for H1B, which hypothesizes that donors are more likely to give to their strategic allies in the wake of a natural disaster to further their own self-interest, we would have expected the parameter estimate for the interaction term between strategic interest and natural disasters to be negative, which it is not. Moreover, we would have expected to observe a downward sloping relationship between strategic interest and humanitarian interest as the number of natural disasters increases. This is clearly not evidenced in the ``Humanitarian Aid'' panel in Figure \ref{fig:simEffects}. 

Meanwhile, we test H2 by examining the effect of the interaction between strategic interest and natural disasters on civil society aid. In Figure \ref{fig:intCoef}, we find a positive and significant relationship between this interaction and civil society aid. The substantive effects plot (in the ``Civil Society Aid'' panel in Figure \ref{fig:simEffects}) meanwhile also suggests that donors are more likely to target aid to civil society in their strategic adversaries the more natural disasters that country experiences, supporting H2. These results are provide support for the idea that donors may be acting to take advantage of vulnerable recipients to mold the relationship to their interests. 

Finally, we test H3 by analyzing how the interaction between strategic interest and natural disasters affects development aid allocation. From, Figure  \ref{fig:intCoef}, we can see that this coefficient is not statistically significant. However, examining the substantive significance in Figure \ref{fig:simEffects} (``Development Aid'' panel) we can see that the relationship between strategic interest and development aid allocation is consistently downward sloping. This suggests that donors tend to give more development aid to strategic allies rather than strategic opponents, showing strong support for H3.  These results indicate that irrespective of natural disaster intensity, development aid is reserved for strategic allies of donor countries and does not alter the strategic calculus donor countries undertake. 

\subsection*{Persistence of foreign aid allocation over time}

How persistent are these estimated effects? To answer this question, we re-estimate the original models for different lag lengths of the main interaction and constituent terms\footnote{The controls are measured using a one-year lag throughout.}. These models are estimated separately for each lag length (lags of 1, 3, and 5 years). The simulation results when using different lags for the interactions and constituent terms are shown in Figures \ref{fig:humanIntCoef}, \ref{fig:civIntCoef}, and \ref{fig:devIntCoef} for the outcome variables humanitarian aid, civil society aid and development aid, respectively.

	\label{fig:humanIntCoef}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:humanIntCoef}, we can see that the interaction between strategic interest and natural disasters is persistent until approximately five years after a natural disaster. This suggests that donors seek to use natural disasters as a tactic to improve relations with strategic opponents for a number of years after the initial disaster  (supporting H1C).

%that donors are more likely to allocate humanitarian aid to their strategic adversaries for some time following a natural disaster, suggesting

% sm: this sentence is not clear tome: Another interpretation is that civil society aid is actually rather effective and as such, recipients governments are likely to push back against allowing it in fairly short order.
Figure \ref{fig:civIntCoef} shows that while the interaction between strategic interest and natural disasters positively affects the allocation of civil society aid, this effect is only consistent for a short time following a natural disaster. One way to interpret these results is that donors recognize the difficulty of trying to influence domestic politics through civil society aid relatively quickly, and thus waste relatively little time in pursuing such attempts. Another interpretation is that civil society aid is actually rather effective and as such, recipients governments are likely to push back against allowing it in fairly short order. Teasing out the exact mechanism would be a fruitful area for future research.

Last, Figure \ref{fig:devIntCoef} extends the earlier finding that the interaction between strategic interest and natural disasters has little effect on development aid across a variety of different lags. This result further suggests that there is strong support for H3, that is donor counties focus on reserving development aid for strategic allies.
