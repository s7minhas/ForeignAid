	Many studies have come out in recent years trying to predict foreign aid flows \citep{alesina:2000,dreher:2012,werker:2012}. To that end, scholars have advanced and tested a number of hypotheses with regards to two related questions: i) why some countries recieve foriegn aid and others do not ii) why some countries recieve certain levels of foreign aid given that they recieve foreign aid at all.  These range from the economic need of the recipient country, the strategic interest of the donor country or the cultural affinity between the recipient and donor country, among others. \\

\indent\indent	Despite the scholarly attention devoted to this subject, there is not only little consensus from paper to paper as to which motivations are more important in determining foreign aid allocation but little consensus within papers as well. Many scholars find for example that the factors which strongly determine foreign aid flows when they analyze all donor countries together are often inconsistent with the motivations they find to be important when they investigate the determinants of foreign aid allocations each donor country individually \citep{schraeder.etal:1998,berthelemy:2006}. \\

\indent\indent	Each of these approaches analyzes foreign aid flows in a dyadic context where they assume that the flow of aid between any particular dyad is independent of any other.  Yet, scholars are well aware that there may be dependence in foreign aid allocations. Some scholars hypothesize for example that donors exhibit 'herding' \citep{frot:2011} or 'lead donorship' \citep{steinwand:2014}\footnote{ Wherin a recipient country is likely to recive the majority of its aid from one country, the assumption being that other donor countries are dissuaded from giving aid to that recipient country precisely because it already has a major donor} behavior.
 



	As many studies (Ward, Siverson, XAo xxxx; Cranmer, Desmareis, Menninga xxxx; others) have shown this assumption is often untenable within IR structures. 

	We propose an analysis of foreign aid in a network context where

	Controlling for network effects will allow for a more precise test of even teh monadic and dyadic level coefficient estimates that have been proposed
