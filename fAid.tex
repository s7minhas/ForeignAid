% In recent years, numerous studies have sought to explain the strategic and political motivations that direct foreign aid flows (e.g., \citealp{alesina:2000}; \citealp{berthelemy:2006}; \citealp{werker:2012}). To that end, scholars have tested many monadic and dyadic level hypotheses have done so using widely inconsistent measures of `strategic interest'. Moreover all the extant literature analyzes aid flows in a dyadic context where the assumption is that the flow of aid between any particular dyad is independent of any other. However, scholars are well aware of potential dependence in foreign aid allocations. Some scholars hypothesize for example that donors exhibit “herding” \citep{frot:2011}  or "lead donorship” behavior \citep{steinwand:2014}— wherein donor countries are dissuaded from giving aid to a country that already has a major donor. This is also empirically problematic as failing to account for interdependencies leads to biased coefficients and standard errors. To explicitly incorporate these interdependencies, we used a mixed hierarchical model with random effects. In doing so we are able to shed new light onto the political and strategic considerations underlying the distribution of foreign aid in the international system.

While the existing literature shows that bilateral donors primarily allocate aid to strategic allies, anecdotal evidence suggests that following natural disasters, bilateral aid flows to strategic opponents quite generously. We square this incongruity by arguing donors use natural disasters as opportunities improve their relationships with strategic opponents through the allocation of humanitarian aid. Donors also forward their self-interest by increasing civil society aid in a natural disaster's aftermath. We substantiate our findings using a new measure of strategic interest that accounts for the indirect ties states share and the multiple dimensions in which they interact.
