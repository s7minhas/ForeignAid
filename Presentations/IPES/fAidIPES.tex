\textit{H1A:  Donors who are strategic opponents of the recipient are more likely than strategic allies to be sensitive to the humanizing effect of natural disasters. As such, following natural disasters, donors are likely to send \textbf{similar amounts of humanitarian aid to strategic allies and strategic opponents.}}

  \frametitle{Extant Approaches to Modeling Strategic Interest}
  \begin{itemize}
 % \item  Consensus is that strategic interest takes precedence over humanitarian ones in country level foreign aid allocation
 % \pause
  \item Within this literature strategic interest takes on a variety of operationalizations, most commonly: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Alliances (e..g, Schraeder et al. 1998)
    \item UN Voting Scores (e.g., Dreher and Fuchs 2015)
    \item Common IGO Membership (e.g., Bermeo 2008)
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \item Alesina and Dollar (2000): 
  \begin{quote}
    unfortunately the measurement of what a ``strategic interest'' is varies from study to study and is occasionaly tautological

\theta_{i,j} = a_i + b_j + \gamma_{i,j} + z_i'z_j

\begin{itemize}
  \item where $\theta_{i,j}$ is the dyadic variable of interest
  \item $a_i$ estimates sender effects
  \item $b_j$ estimates receiver effects
  \item $z_i'z_j$ is the bilinear effect which estimates the latent space
\end{itemize}

We estimate the model via Gibbs sampling using the full conditionals of the parameters
