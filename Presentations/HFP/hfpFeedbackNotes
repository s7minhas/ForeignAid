- strategic goals
- aid is going to watch dogs

too much information, 

not convinced if its not strategic

H1B: 

why do donors overpay in the constructivist sense
they pay equal amounts of humanitarian aid, why do they overpay the opponents

maybe its a realist view overall, they over pay specific countries, regional powers, which drives the finding

country donors get a foot in the door , they have to overpay , they do it to disperse civil society aid 

use in humanitarian aid in the analysis of civil society aid 


how prominent are these order effects after all 

if you have taken the third order effect into account, you can find the effect for each and every donor

donor effects

binary disaster; disaster dummy

short term and long term

aid commitments, actual dispersements for humanitarian aid would capture better more immediately

three components - IGO and alliances are rather sticky, is UN voting, where does the variance come from

would be nice to know what the variation is

put in OECD countries

Nora:
hypotheses 1B, which would be stronger on 
evidence? 


strengthen a better and stronger state


strategic distance is a function of the government of the moemnt, rather than in the structure of the international system; if you see no opportunity for overcoming that strategic distance, then civil soceity aid then providing civil society aid shouldn't make much sense. 

first natural disaster might have a much bigger effect

cognitive effects, then suggests cumultative effects 



really need to say more about how this thing works out


othering effects

bayesian constructivism



----------
you need to have a certain expectation to change that relationship in some lasting way, for a pure constructivist way to make sense

are the contributions clear?

who would you like to have a reviewer as a paper? 

cindy cheng,

put in more citations


don't like the framing

redo the abstract, 
foreign aid literature has shown that strategic interests most important drivers of foreign aid, but .... anecotdoal evidence 

we need a really good measure of strategic interest, we accomplish a, b, c


page 6 to 7, examples, taiwan not having used the 1976 earthquake, i will revie ; invade it seems artificial and , offensive gesture


little referenced material that; public resources , page 

bayesian constructivism  --- don't really need a head on contrast, because some realists consider themselves constructivists

most of the rest of the paper doesn't really sound constructivist, so a bayesian ; updating 

on your near measure, using that measure changes that measure otherwise 

dustin tingly's advice, if you're introducing a methodological innovation, make big deal about how that's helpful, show how its changing some result, 


diversion, or on top of, redistribution within countries and redistribution across countries
