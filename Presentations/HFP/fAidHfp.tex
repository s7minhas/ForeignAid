  \frametitle{Extant Approaches to Modeling Strategic Interest}
  \begin{itemize}
 % \item  Consensus is that strategic interest takes precedence over humanitarian ones in country level foreign aid allocation
 % \pause
  \item Within this literature strategic interest takes on a variety of operationalizations, most commonly: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Alliances (e..g, Schraeder et al. 1998)
    \item UN Voting Scores (e.g., Dreher and Fuchs 2015)
    \item Common IGO Membership (e.g., Bermeo 2008)
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \item Alesina and Dollar (2000): 
  \begin{quote}
    unfortunately the measurement of what a ``strategic interest'' is varies from study to study and is occasionaly tautological
  \end{quote}

\theta_{i,j} = a_i + b_j + \gamma_{i,j} + z_i'z_j

\begin{itemize}
  \item where $\theta_{i,j}$ is the dyadic variable of interest
  \item $a_i$ estimates sender effects
  \item $b_j$ estimates receiver effects
  \item $z_i'z_j$ is the bilinear effect which estimates the latent space
\end{itemize}

We estimate the model via Gibbs sampling using the full conditionals of the parameters
