strategic interest is overwhelming the paper

would you be expecting changes in aid with regards to all categories, or disaster relief
	what is aggregate aid data actually captuing
	disaggregate categories
	are disaster assistance overweighted? if not then what does that mean?
	how long does this effect last for? 

natural disaster data 
	- could perhaps help you get better identification for altrusitic/strategic pathway
	- number of natural disasters: altrustic, more; strategic, less
	- intensity of disaster

how aid is being discussed before/after natural disaster, to show this is about changing social norms.
