  \frametitle{Extant Approaches to Modeling Strategic Interest}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  Consensus is that strategic interest takes precedence over humanitarian ones in country level foreign aid allocation
  \pause
  \item Within this literature strategic interest takes on a variety of operationalizations, most commonly: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Alliances (e..g, Schraeder et al. 1998)
    \item UN Voting Scores (e.g., Dreher and Fuchs 2015)
    \item Common IGO Membership (e.g., Bermeo 2008)
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \item Alesina and Dollar (2000): 
  \begin{quote}
    unfortunately the measurement of what a ``strategic interest'' is varies from study to study and is occasionaly tautological
  \end{quote}

  \frametitle{Latent Space Analysis}

\begin{align*}
\theta_{i,j} = a_i + b_j + \gamma_{i,j} + z_i'z_j
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
  \item where $\theta_{i,j}$ is the dyadic variable of interest
  \item $a_i$ estimates sender effects
  \item $b_j$ estimates receiver effects
  \item $z_i'z_j$ is the bilinear effect which estimates the latent space
\end{itemize}

We estimate the model via Gibbs sampling using the full conditionals of the parameters

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Next we estimate the euclidean distance between the posterior positions of every country for every year
  \pause
  \item We estimate a PCA for each year separately and use the first principal component for each year as our measure of strategic interest
  % \item On average over all the years, we find that our political strategic interest variable, that is the first component of our PCA of the combination of alliances explains about 71\% of its variance

  \item We focus on the 18 most active senders and 167 receivers of aid flows from 1975 to 2006
