ForeignAid
==========

Goal is to predict aid flows from OECD to developing countries.

Data: 

	DAC - aid flows

		different types of aid

	Add in China

	Missingness

Problem: 

	If the US gives Congo a million dollars this may give France incentive

	M x N

	Bayesian random effects model

		higher order characteristics

		lower order characteristics dyad specific


methodological contribution

	two step model

		first predict any aid, then level

	estimating yearly models

		imputation would be useful here

	account somehow for dyadic dependence

		bayesian approach?

other explanations

	disasters, data is available online at yearly level

disaggregating need

	that's where hdi and other stuff comes in

steps: 

	overall question: predict aid flows

	what model we want to use

	narrow down contribution so we have some story to share
